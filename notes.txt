        1. Logic to potentially remove a node from its membership list

            NOTE: Does this mean to track last send time? Check if such concept already exists ....

        #define TREMOVE 20
        #define TFAIL 5

        Didn't hear back in TFail seconds:

            -> Mark for deletion
            NOTE: Mark for deletion isn't the same as immediate deletion. Treat node as up when gossip the list
        
        If TFAIL + TRemove has passed:

            -> Remove from list
        
        2. Reconcile data received

            When we receive a response, take the max result from a given node (that isn't self)

        3. At each timestep, increment local heartbeat (this is only thing a given node can control)
